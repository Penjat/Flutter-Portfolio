# flutter_portfolio

A portfolio built in Flutter that showcases some sofetware and hardware projects I have worked on over the years.

My old portfolio was made in HTML, CSS, and javascript.  It still works fine, but to update it I needed to copy, paste and edit HTML code every time. I work on a lot of different projects and it has proven to be a real pain to keep my portfolio updated. I wanted something where I can just type in the data and my portfolio will update itself.  I thought this would also be a great oppertunity to advance my skills in Flutter and in web development in general.
